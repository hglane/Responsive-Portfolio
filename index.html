        As a kid growing up in the most southeastern corner of Alabama, I never thought I would find myself living in the midwest until it actually happened. In my high school years, I spent all of the time I could outisde in the woods or on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico. When the time came to graduate, despite growing up in a household of Auburn University graduates, I decided to attend the University of Alabama. 
        After earning a degree in finance, I took my first job out of school with a consulting firm that placed finance managers in car dealerships around the country. My first landing spot was Dallas, Texas, and it was here that I completed a 3 month long crash course training of the financial realm of the automobile industry. I was then placed in Kellogg, Idaho where I worked as a finance manager at the nation's largest Chrysler dealership for a little over a year. I was then presented with an opportunity to work in Columbia, Missouri with the Joe Machens Auto Group, and I worked there for 6 months before making my way over to Kansas City. 
        I now work in the commercial loan servicing department at Commerce Bank in downtown Kansas City.
